# Data Analysis with Python

This repository contains the code and data for a project on data wrangling with Python. The project was created as part of a workshop on data analysis with Python.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned the following:

- Basics of Python programming
- Data analysis concepts and techniques
- Pandas library for data manipulation
- Matplotlib library for data visualization

## Project Overview

- The project involves cleaning, transforming, and analyzing 3-4 types of datasets.
- The goal is to prepare the data for further analysis and insights.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following files:

- `data.csv`: The movie ratings dataset
- `data_wrangling.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the data wrangling code

## Instructions

To run the data wrangling code, you will need to have Python and the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries installed. Once you have the necessary dependencies, you can open the `data_wrangling.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment and run the cells to execute the code.

## Contributions

This project is open to contributions. Feel free to submit pull requests with improvements or additions to the code.
